## Hash Table Data structure in JavaScript

## A hash table is an associative array data structure that maps keys to values & it is capable to store a large amount of data and retrieving specific elements efficiently.
## For Example, We want to create a Phone Number directory of all Users so in this case, the key would be User names & the value would be their phone numbers including other things like STD Code, Country Code, etc.

## Notes: Objects in JavaScript are a type of Hash Tables as well.

## Hash function performs a vital role here. it takes key and bucket size as an argument & performs any arithmetic operations on it and returns a hash value that is used as an Index to store key-value pair elements in storage.
